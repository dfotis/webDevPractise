                        <blockquote>
                            If programmers deserve to be rewarded for creating innovative programs,
                            by the same token they deserve to be punished if they restrict the use of these programs.
                        </blockquote>

                        <blockquote>Free software is software that respects your freedom and the social solidarity of your community. 
                            So it's free as in freedom.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>
                            If you want to accomplish something in the world, idealism is not enough - you need to choose a method that works 
                            to achieve the goal.
                        </blockquote>

                        </blockquote>     

                        <blockquote>Also, because schools must teach the spirit of goodwill, the habit of helping others around you, every class should have this rule: 
                            students, if you bring software to class you may not keep it for yourself.</blockquote>

                        <blockquote>
                            The reason that a good citizen does not use such destructive means to become wealthier is that, if everyone did so, 
                            we would all become poorer from the mutual destructiveness.
                        </blockquote>

                        <blockquote>
                            With paper printed books, you have certain freedoms. You can acquire the book anonymously by paying cash, which is the way I always buy books. 
                            I never use a credit card. I don't identify to any database when I buy books. Amazon takes away that freedom.
                        </blockquote>

                        <blockquote>
                            I could have made money this way, and perhaps amused myself writing code. But I knew that at the end of my career, I would 
                            look back on years of building walls to divide people, and feel I had spent my life making the world a worse place.
                        </blockquote>

                        <blockquote>
                            If you use a proprietary program or somebody else's web server, you're defenceless. You're putty in the hands of whoever developed that software.
